##MNIST Digit Recognition CNN Model - README
#Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves high accuracy in classifying digits 0-9.

#Features
CNN architecture with 2 convolutional layers and max pooling

Dropout layer to prevent overfitting

Training and validation accuracy visualization

Model evaluation on test data

Prediction visualization on sample images

Model saving capability

#Requirements
Python 3.6+

TensorFlow 2.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

#Installation
Clone this repository

Install required packages:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
#Usage
Run the script to:

Load and preprocess MNIST dataset

Build and train the CNN model

Evaluate model performance

Visualize predictions

Save the trained model

#Training the Model
The model trains for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128. 20% of the training data is used for validation.

#Model Architecture
Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
#Performance
The model typically achieves:

Training accuracy: ~99%

Validation accuracy: ~98-99%

Test accuracy: ~98-99%

#Output
Training progress (accuracy/loss per epoch)

Accuracy plot (training vs validation)

Saved model file: digit_recognition_cnn_model.h5

#How to Use the Saved Model

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('digit_recognition_cnn_model.h5')
predictions = model.predict(new_images)
